      "content": "The issue here is not with the composition time, but with the GPU load. In other words, it’s not a library bug; it’s simply that the GPU is struggling. I’ve faced a similar issue even in online paint. Providing a demo is challenging, but I guess you could achieve this effect by heavily loading the GPU (e.g., using a benchmark) and then using the Draw interraction.       Regarding the separate canvas, yes, that was my initial attempt. I added className: \"draw-layer\" here. However, the main canvas still updates during events. Currently, the idea is to add here a simple check (smth like event.originalEvent.target.className === \"draw-layer\" && layer !== sketchLayer) and and ignore move events for all layers except sketchlayer.",

      "content": "Just a last (but no least) note: import() may looks like a function call, but it isn't a Function. It's a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses (similar to what happens with super()). So it's not possible to assign import to a variable or use things of the Function prototype, like call/apply."
